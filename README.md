### Project Goals

- Link: https://afratetlay.github.io/blurry-image/ 

- I wanted to create a small project which shows off some javascript skills, here is an image which initially shows blurry but then changes to a clear image. 
- I am trying to get familiar with JavaScript, so I thought a small project will enhance my learning in the language. I have made noted in my js file so the code is readable to anyone viewing the code.
